# Online Integrated Platform for Student Projects

This project was developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2023 (SIH 2023) under the Government of Jharkhand. 
Our team, Atomic Technigeers, created a robust web portal that integrates and manages projects taken up by students across various universities and colleges.
The platform allows institutions and students to upload, manage, and display projects, providing a centralized and secure environment for academic collaboration.

# Idea/Solution/Prototype
The project focuses on creating a web portal connected to a centralized database, enabling students and institutions to upload, manage, and showcase their academic projects. The platform features three distinct portals:

Student Portal: Students can upload their projects either individually or under the guidance of an institution.
Options to make projects public or private, depending on the owner's preference.
Institution Portal:

Institutions can view, access, upload, and manage projects submitted by their students.
Ability to approve or discard projects based on quality and relevance.
Public Access Portal:

View-only access for the public to explore available projects.
Search and filter projects based on categories, institutions, and other parameters.

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the platform, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

# Technologies Used
Initially, this project was based solely on HTML and CSS. However, I am now looking to enhance it by incorporating JavaScript, React for the frontend, and Express with MongoDB for the backend.
